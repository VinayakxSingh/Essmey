Review of essmey-perfume/src/utils/context.jsx:

1. Imports:
- React hooks and sanityClient imported correctly.

2. State:
- cartItems, wishlistItems, user, isAuthenticated, searchResults states are defined properly.

3. Effects:
- Loading and saving cart and wishlist to localStorage handled correctly.

4. Wishlist and Cart functions:
- Functions for adding/removing/updating items are implemented correctly.

5. Search function:
- handleSearch is async and queries Sanity with GROQ.
- GROQ query filters products by name matching searchTerm.
- Image field fetched as images[0].asset->url which matches schema.
- Error handling in catch block is appropriate.

6. Context Provider:
- All states and functions are provided in the context value.
- useAppContext hook correctly returns useContext(AppContext).

7. Potential improvements:
- Consider debouncing handleSearch calls to reduce query frequency.
- Add loading state for search to improve UX.
- Validate that product _id field matches usage in other functions (some use _id, some use id).
- Ensure consistent naming for product id across app.

8. Syntax:
- No syntax errors detected.
- Template literals and string concatenations are correct.

Overall, the context.jsx file is well structured and should work correctly for search functionality with Sanity.

If you want, I can help implement debouncing or loading state next.
